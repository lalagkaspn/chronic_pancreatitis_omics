Generally you want the number of running threads to be no more than the number of cores allocated to the job.
detectCores() doesn't work with the way the Slurm limits the number of cores available.
Instead, use the environment variable SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK to get the correct number.

cores = as.integer(Sys.getenv("SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK"))
