1. ERAP2 is a novel target involved in autophagy and activation of pancreatic stellate cells via unfolded protein response signaling pathway
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by excessive desmoplasia and autophagy-dependent tumorigenic growth. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) as a predominant stromal cell type play a critical role in PDAC biology. Autophagy facilitates PSC activation. However, the mechanism remains unknown. To investigate the mechanism of autophagy in PSC activation, gene expression profiles between patient-derived PSCs from pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis were compared using a gene expression microarray. more...

3. Gene expression of endothelial cells isolated from pancreatic cancer tissues and from chronic pancreatitis tissues
(Submitter supplied) Endothelial cells existed in the cancer tissue have unique biological characteristics that are different from those found in the noncancerous tissue of the same organ. In order to investigate molecular mechanisms involved in the unique biological phenotypes of endothelial cells in the cancer tissue, we compared gene expression profiles of endothelial cells isolated from pancreatic cancer tissues with those from chronic pancreatitis tissues.

4. Disease associated fibroblasts from various pancreatic disorders exhibit subtype specific genetic profile [RNA]
(Submitter supplied) Currently it is unknown whether activation of recruited or resident pancreatic fibroblasts, including pancreatic stellate cells activation, create a common “fibroblast-activated phenotype” indistinguishable from their associated-diseased microenvironment . Using a combination of microRNA and mRNA profiling of fibroblasts isolated from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), chronic pancreatitis (CP), periampullary cancer (PAT) and areas of histologically normal pancreas, followed by comprehensive validation, we show that activated fibroblasts derived from different pancreatic disease types are considerably distinct.

5. Expression data in patients with familial (FCS) and multifactorial chylomicronemia (MCM)
(Submitter supplied) FCS and MCM appear highly similar disorders. However, they importantly differ in term of risk and response to treatments. Some sets of genes might be up or down regulated in both disorders and could partly explain those differences. We used microarrays to explore gene expression patterns in FCS and MCM patients to identify potential targets that can be selected for protein quantification and functional studies.

6. Role of BAP1 in pancreatic cancer (PrimeView)
(Submitter supplied) Transcriptional profile of PANC1 cells with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion of BAP1 We found that BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein-1) shows loss of heterozygosity in over 25% of pancreatic cancer patients and functions as tumor suppressor. Conditional deletion of Bap1 in murine pancreas led to genomic instability, accumulation of DNA damage, and an inflammatory response that evolved to pancreatitis with full penetrance. more...

7. Skeletal Muscle Fibrosis in Pancreatic Cancer Patients with Respect to Survival
(Submitter supplied) Skeletal muscle wasting is a devastating consequence of cancer that may be responsible for nearly 30% of cancer-related deaths. In addition to muscle atrophy, we have identified significant muscle fiber damage and replacement of muscle with fibrotic tissue in rectus abdominis muscle biopsies from cachectic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients that associates with poor survival. Transcriptional profiling of muscle harvested from these same patients supported these findings by identifying gene clusters related to wounding, inflammation and cellular response to TGF-B upregulated in cachectic PDAC patients compared with non-cancer controls. more...

8. Transcriptome as marker for nutrition-related health: added value of time course analyses during challenge tests before and after energy restriction
(Submitter supplied) Phenotypic flexibility is used as a measure for health and can be studied during nutritional challenge tests. Changes in gene expression are early markers and give insight into mechanisms. Energy restriction (ER) has a variety of beneficial health effects and can be used to investigate different health states to study postprandial changes during challenge tests. Objective: We aimed to determine the postprandial effects of a 20% ER diet on whole genome expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). more...

9. Microarray gene-expression data to validate a 17-gene biomarker obtained from excessive meta-analysis to test its PDAC specificity in the presence of pancreatitis tissues.
(Submitter supplied) Clinical signs and radiographic findings of PDAC and pancreatitis are often indistinguishable, highlighting the need of a PDAC biomarker to be insensitive to pancreatitis. Therefore we validated a biomarker signature of 17-genes in this gene expression data containing PDAC, non-tumor pancreatic and pancreatitis of fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.

11. Acute Appendicitis: Transcript Profiling of blood identifies promising biomarkers and potential underlying processes
(Submitter supplied) Background: The diagnosis of acute appendicitis can be surprisingly difficult without computed tomography, which carries significant radiation exposure. Genome-wide expression profiling was applied to whole blood RNA of acute appendicitis patients versus patients with other abdominal disorders, in order to identify biomarkers of appendicitis. From a large cohort of emergency patients, a discovery set of patients with surgically confirmed appendicitis, or abdominal pain from other causes, was identified. more...

16. Global mRNA/LncRNA expression analysis of pancreatic tumors causing type3C Diabetes Mellitus
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic tumors with small size can cause type3C Diabetes Mellitus (PCA-DM) but the mechanism is unknown. In this study we aimed at revealing the mRNA and long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) expression patterns of pancreatic tumors that triggered PCA-DM. Four pancreatic tumors from patients with PCA-DM (A1-A4), four pancreatic tumors from patients without PCA-DM (B1-B4), and four pancreatic tissues from patients with pancreatitis were individually profiled with Agilent microarrays(Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0).

(Submitter supplied) This dataset encompassing the profiles of 150 lung cancer tumors was developed to serve as test dataset in the SBV IMPROVER Diagnostic Signature Challenge (sbvimprover.com). The aim of this subchallenge was to verify that it is possible to extract a robust diagnostic signature from gene expression data that can identify stages of different types of lung cancer. Participants were asked to develop and submit a classifier that can stratify lung cancer patients in one of four groups – Stage 1 of Adenocarcinoma (AC Stage 1), Stage 2 of Adenocarcinoma (AC Stage 2), Stage 1 of Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC Stage 1) or Stage 2 of Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC Stage 2). more...

18. Long noncoding intronic RNAs are differentially expressed in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known by its aggressiveness and lack of effective therapeutic options. Thus, improvement in current knowledge of molecular changes associated with pancreatic cancer is urgently needed to explore novel venues of diagnostics and treatment of this dismal disease. While there is mounting evidence that long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) transcribed from intronic and intergenic regions of the human genome may play different roles in the regulation of gene expression in normal and cancer cells, their expression pattern and biological relevance in pancreatic cancer is currently unknown. more...

22. Multiple Salivary Biomarkers for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death. Lack of early detection technology for pancreatic cancer invariably leads to a typical clinical presentation of incurable disease at initial diagnosis. Oral fluid (saliva) meets the demand for non-invasive, accessible, and highly efficient diagnostic medium. The level of salivary analytes, such as mRNA and microflora, vary upon disease onset; thus possess valuable signatures for early detection and screening. more...
